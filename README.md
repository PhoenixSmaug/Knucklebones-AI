# An AI for the dice game Knucklebones

Knucklebones is a highly random dice game developed by the studio [Massive Monster](https://massivemonster.co) available to play online [here](https://knucklebones.io). There you can also find a summary of the rules of the game; a more detailed explanation also given on the [Fandom Wiki](https://cult-of-the-lamb.fandom.com/wiki/Knucklebones). The goal of this project is to train an AI for Knucklebones using various methods and compare the resulting models. So far, the following methods are implemented:

- **Monte Carlo tree search:** Heuristic search algorithm for exploring the game tree
- **Q-Learning:** Policy obtained from Reinforcement Learning
- **Deep Q-Network Algorithm:** Q-Learning augmented with a Deep neural network to help in large state spaces
