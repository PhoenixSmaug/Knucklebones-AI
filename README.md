# An AI for the dice game Knucklebones

Knucklebones is a highly random dice game developed by the studio [Massive Monster](https://massivemonster.co) available to play online [here](https://knucklebones.io). There you can also find a summary of the rules of the game; a more detailed explanation also given on the [Fandom Wiki](https://cult-of-the-lamb.fandom.com/wiki/Knucklebones). The goal of this project was to train an AI for Knucklebones by self play using the Reinforcement Learning library [Stable-Baselines3](https://stable-baselines3.readthedocs.io).
